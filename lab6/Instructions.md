# Lab Test Exam

The purpose of is to simulate a test environment before you actually have to take the exam. This is just a random exam question that I came up with, it has no reference to past, current or future exams. However, it will test the material that you all have learned during the first half of this course.

Remember to follow the design recipe and remember to test your helpers!!

## Question

This question requires you to write code for the classes and interfaces found in MOT.java in this folder. I have provided examples so that you can write tests more quickly but you can always add more examples.

a) Design a method for `IMOT` that determines whether this mode of transportation is more fuel efficient than the given mode of transportation. Name the method `motIsMoreFuelEfficientThan`. Put any assumptions you have made while designing this method at the bottom of your examples class.

b) Desgin a method for `Person` that gives the person's modes of transportation ordered by fuel efficiency. Name this method `motsOrderedByFuelEfficiency`.
